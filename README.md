This program gathers information about the system, services, processes, network, authentication, command history, and relevant files for forensic analysis.

Note:

- Grant permissions to the program.
- Run as root to maximize access.
- On systems without systemd, some outputs will be empty; they are still saved.
- The ZIP file is stored in /tmp/<hostname>_YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ.zip.
- AND enjoy the forensic evidence gathering! jeje ;D

Eso es todo, creo... ^_^
